#react-redux-study

This repository has the sole purpose of applying the Pluralsight's James CharlesÂ´s React-Redux course concepts.

The goal is applying gradually the concepts of the course in the folder my-redux. The my-redux folder was created from the folder no-redux. The folder redux contains the situation in wich my-redux is supposed to get.

To enforce the concepts of the gitflow, this will also be used.
